Art Play Date encourages toddlers to look closely at an artwork through songs, movement and play. Each session includes an artwork viewing and a loose parts play session that gives children lots of time to explore objects inspired by what they have seen.

When
Art Play Date has concluded for the year. A new program will begin in March 2025 and will be available to book online from February.

We offer three Art Play Date programs per year commencing in autumn, winter and spring. Please note that content is repeated across all dates in a season.

Sessions are scheduled on selected Tuesdays at 10:15am and 11:30am and run for approximately 45 minutes.

Location
This program is scheduled at either the Queensland Art Gallery or the Gallery of Modern Art at different times of the year. Please check your booking confirmation for session details.

The other thing is they are happy with the result.
